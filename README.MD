    <p>
        EpicFarming is a fully customizable plugin that will change the way players farm on your server forever. The plugins allows players to create farms that can                     automatically harvest and replant crops such as wheat, carrots, potatos, sugarcane, kelp and cacti. It also allows players to store the harvested crops in the farmitem           for periodic collection, automatically breed animals such as cows, chickens, pigs and sheep, automatically kill animals that you spawn, breed or lure in range of the             farmitem. EpicFarming can be fully customized so that as players upgrade their farms, they gain access to different features, larger ranges for the farmitem and faster           growth of crops in their farms.<br>
        If you ever wanted a way to change the tedious task of farming on your server so it is fun and automated for your players, then EpicFarming is the perfect plugin for             your server.
